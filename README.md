Instagram Challenge
===================

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

This is a simple app with features resembling those in Instagram.

To do:
1. Add features for editing and deleting pictures uploaded.
2. Restrict actions of users - only those signed in should be able to make comments and like pictures.
3. Restrict the number of times each user can like a picture to once.
4. Add features for editing and deleting comments - restricted to the user who made the comment.
5. Add CSS styling - possibly using bootstrap.
6. Use Amazon Web Services for picture uploads rather than local file structure, so that the app can be deployed to Heroku.
7. Increase test coverage by testing the associations between models.
8. Add a tags features so that pictures can be filtered by tag.
